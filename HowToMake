// CS 122A Fall 2018 Remote Bike Lock Project by Geoffrey Nguyen. Edited December 2018. 

This is a DIY project on how to make a remote bike lock. You will need a few things:

- ATmega1284
- Power source, 5V and 12V
- Adafruit square force-sensing resistor
- Bluetooth Chip HC 05
- TIP102 Transistor
- 12V Solenoid Lock
- Wires, LEDs, Resistors
- WB-106 Breadboard
- Atmel-ICE
- Atmel-ICE Cable
- USB A Male-to-Male Cable
- Small box and tape
- Smartphone, with a Bluetooth terminal installed/

  After you have all these parts, you are ready to make your remote bike lock. First, place your ATmega1284 on your breadboard,
preferrably somewhere where the first pin on the ATmega1284 lines up with the 11th or 21st spot on your breadboard. After doing so, place
a power source on the right side of the breadboard near the top. This will be powering most of the hardware on the board. Then, place 
wires from pin B0 to pin B6 (pins 1 to 7) on the ATmega1284 (the pins starting from the top left and down to the 7th port) and put the other end of those
wires on the right side of the breadboard, below your power source. These wires are going to connect to some LEDs that will measure how
much pressure is placed.

  Once all the wires are placed, connect resistors to each one of those wires and put them to nodes with empty rows. Then, in that same row,
connect LEDs to each resistor and ground them. The long end of the LED should be in parallel to the resistor, while the short end of the 
LED connects to ground. Now you have set up all your LEDs. 

  The next step is to connect your Bluetooth HC 05 chip on your breadboard. Place this on the left side of the breadboard, preferrably 
in the middle. Have the side with the labels that say EN, VCC, GND, etc. facing away fron the microcontroller. Now, assuming that
you have the 6 ports that the Bluetooth chip comes with, wire your circuit exactly as described:

- Top node (EN) leave empty. 
- Second from the top (VCC) connect to 5V.
- Third from the top (GND) connect to ground. 
- Fourth from the top (TXD) connect to pin 14 on the microcontroller. On the microcontroller, this should be the RXD0 pin. 
- Fifth from the top (RXD) connecto to pin 15 on the microcontroller. On the microcontroller, this should be the TXD0 pin.
- Sixth from the bottom (STATE) leave empty.

Turn on your power supply, and open up the Bluetooth terminal on your phone. On your board, you should be seeing your Bluetooth chip 
blinking on and off. If it isn't, then either your power is off, your chip may be damaged, or you may have JTAG turned on your Atmel
studio. Hopefully, you are able to fix and resolve this issue in some way. After, turn on the Bluetooth function on your phone, and
connect to the Bluetooth chip that you just plugged in. Assuming no other Bluetooth devices are around, you should be able to see your 
chip, labelled "HC 05". If it asks for a password of some sort, enter the default pin, which should be 1234, 12345, 0000, or some other 
basic number. 
with your Bluetooth module that you just plugged in.
